My daughters have even done this hairstyle on each other since it's an easy hairstyle for kids to do!\nWhat makes this hairstyle simple is that you only need to know how to do a regular braid in order to create the great side braid look.  As this hairstyle is so easy, it is also quick which means that you can use this hairstyle as a great go-to for an easy hairstyle for school. \n\nTo begin this hairstyle you need to part off one small section of hair next to the ear.  Then divide this section into three smaller sections.  Pin two of the sections out of the way.  \n\nWith the free section of hair, begin a simple braid.  When you have the braid completed gently tug on one side of the braid to pop the edge of the braid outward.  Secure the braid with an elastic leaving the ends in the elastic to create a loop.  Use the loop and begin to roll the braid up into a bun.  \n\nSecure the bun against the head with bobby pins.  Repeat these steps with the other two braids to create a triangle shape of rosette looking buns.  \nThis easy hairstyle for girls is sure to impress and would love fabulous in so many settings!

This DIY hairstyle may look complicated, but in reality it is super simple and quick to do! You will love this look for a prom hairstyle, a holiday party hairstyle, or even a romantic beach hairstyle look  \n\nTo recreate this DIY hairstyle tutorial you begin by creating a lace braid on the side of the head near the temple.  Only adding hair into the one side of the braid.  Then I go back and pancake the hair to add fullness and fluff.  \n\nOnce the lace braid is secure then I take the lace braid and another small piece of hair from the other side.  Secure them together.  \n\nFrom this point on you just need to take one piece of hair from each side, twist the hair, and then secure them with an elastic.  Go back and tug on the hair to loosen the twists and make it look so pretty and full.  \n\nThe ease comes from you only needing to use a few elastics and twists.  But the braid itself looks so amazing and beautiful.  It looks like a fancy french braid or a fax french braid.  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHElasticBraid\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"üëçüèª\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\nüíã's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan:\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium \n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

We've been friends with Linda Flowers, the Department Head of Hair & Makeup for both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire ever since we first put up the Katniss braid years ago. Since Linda had a contract for Dancing With The Stars, she was unable to work on the Mockingly movies, with Lionsgate instead hiring Camille Friend. Camille is just as talented, and her team did an amazing job trying to have the hair reflect the mood of the war-trodden State, as in the book.\n\nKatniss' braid in this 3rd movie isn't supposed to be focused so much on style, as her time in the Capitol and in the Games merited. This time around, Panem is at war, with a growing rebellion movement, and the look is supposed to fully reflect that. \n\nThings aren't as they once were, and that's why there is a fundamental change in the Katniss braid.\n\nKatniss still wears a side braid, which as Linda told us is to ensure that she doesn't snag her braid as she removes arrows from the quiver on her back. This time around, the wrapping braids from the left and right are French braids instead of Katniss' signature Dutch braid. For the side braid, the stitching looks very similar to a Simple braid, however it really is a chunky Reverse Fishtail. The look is also supposed to be somewhat messy and disheveled, which is the look we were going for. {The wind and rain in our trailer video shoot certainly helped with that!}\n\nTo see your own photo recreations featured in our app, feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle on IG with: #CGHMockingjayBraid\n\nHope you enjoyed this video, and if you did... please give it a big \"Thumbs Up\"!

We are certain you will too, when you wear this!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 2 small hair elastics, 4-6 small bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFeel free to follow us on BlogLovin, where many YT Gurus have beauty blogs...\nhttp://www.bloglovin.com/blog/1815559\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic: Icing\nby Charity Vance (http://www.youtube.com/CharityVanceMusic)\niTunes Link:  http://tinyurl.com/CharityVanceIcing\nLicense: Personal emailed permission from Charity herself.","date":"2013-12-16T01:02:27.000Z"},{"id":"cZ7IJ2--EoU","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/cZ7IJ2--EoU/0.jpg","title":"How to Create a Double Fishtail Twist | #CGHDoubleFishtailTwist","description":"Feel free to use the #CGHDoubleFishtailTwist tag in your photo recreations!\n\nMy Bailey is becoming quite a good little braider, and she agreed to show you another super cute braid that she has been wearing lately {with lots of compliments coming from her friends}!\n\nIf you know how to fishtail braid, then this style will be easy for you.

Since this is prom season, we decided to finally film this hairstyle for all of you.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHSideFishtailBun\n\nIf you do not know how to fishtail braid, please see our easy step-by-step video here first...\nhttp://tinyurl.com/howtofishtail\n\nBefore the tutorial, I slightly curled the top layer of the hair only, using a curling wand, leaving the underneath layers as is.  I then gathered all of the hair to the side by the right ear and created the fishtail braid.\n\nOnce the braid was finished, I secured it with the hair elastic and tugged on the sides of the braid just to make the braid appear more loose.  Then I rolled the braid up into a bun and pinned it just behind the ear.  \n\nTo avoid having to use so many bobby pins, I used 3 Goody Spin Pins.  These pins are the perfect solution for holding hair buns together all day!  I figure that each spin pin saves you from having to use 2-3 bobby pins, and they come in colors to match your hair type.  If you would like to purchase Goody Spin Pins, you can find them at Wal-Mart, Target, Sally's, etc.  You can also find them on Amazon here... \n\nhttp://amzn.to/1Tck00N\n\nThis braided updo hairstyle is perfect for prom, homecoming, weddings, or on days when you simply want to wear a very unique, but cute, hair bun! I think it turned out very cute!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFTC Disclosure:  This is not a paid review of the Goody¬Æ Spin Pin.  I purchased these myself and use them in my hair bun tutorials.

Right after the movie premier, Linda Flowers, the lead hairstylist on The Hunger Games movie set, personally reached out to CuteGirlsHairstyles when she saw how popular our tutorial was!  Can you believe it... she reached out to US!!!\n\nLinda was so amazed at how iconic the Katniss Braid became, so much that teen girls were wearing the braid to see the movie in theaters!  She recognized that CuteGirlsHairstyles helped in teaching thousands of our fans how to do the braid! As such, Linda offered to give me a \"personal\" tutorial of the many Hunger Games hairstyles over Skype!\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHTrueKatnissBraid\n\nDuring our tutorial, I quickly saw that Katniss' style had a little more to it than what I had originally thought!  Linda showed me how she added the texture into Jennifer Lawrence's hair \"before\" she created the Katniss braid {something I had not figured out}.  She uses a tool called the TopStyler¬Æ {by InStyler¬Æ} to add volume and stranded twists into the diagonal Dutch braid.  I show you how to do this in the tutorial.\n\nYou can find the TopStyler at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ulta, or online at the following link...\n\nhttp://www.topstyler.com/\n\nI appreciate that the TopStyler uses a slow and uniform transfer heat to curl the hair, rather than the immediate hot heat a curling wand provides that only heats the outside of the strand.\n\nThis is the exact look Katniss wore throughout the arena scenes in the movie, taught to CuteGirlsHairstyles personally by the one who created it... Linda Flowers!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFTC Disclosure:  I was provided this TopStyler¬Æ tool free of charge by InStyler¬Æ for review purposes only.

Braid the hair using the regular braiding method.\n4.  Tug on the elbows of the braid to loosen/flatten and soften the braid.\n5.  Curl any loose pieces of hair to frame your face.

You can add bows or flowers as accents if you would like.  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHBohemianFishtail\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2010-05-10T00:16:30.000Z"},{"id":"ILrnmlvoEOY","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/ILrnmlvoEOY/0.jpg","title":"Hair-Wrapped Ponytail | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?
