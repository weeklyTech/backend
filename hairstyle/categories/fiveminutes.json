But there was something truly magical in the air when we filmed this unicorn hairstyle!  I've always wanted to try unicorn hair after being a little girl and being obsessed with My Little Pony :)  I've been so happy that My Little Pony and unicorns are coming back as current trends! \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHUnicornHair\n\nEvery year I love Halloween time, and Halloween 2016 is no exception!  There's something about the fall weather, the pumpkins and mums, football, and of course the Halloween costumes and Halloween makeup.  But I'm an especially big fan of creating amazing hairstyles for Halloween to go with our great costumes for Halloween!  Which is why we created this CGH Spooktorials series! \n\nI know that around this time of year everyone begins looking for hairstyle ideas for Halloween, DIY costumes ideas, last minute costumes, and Halloween makeup ideas.  So I thought I'd make it easy by continuing our Spooktorials and filming some great DIY Halloween videos, DIY costumes, and some great DIY hairstyles.  \n\nObviously we focus on the hairstyle tutorials on this channel, but you will be able to find lots of great DIYs, costume ideas, and other great Halloween-oriented videos between our channel, the BrooklynAndBailey channel, and the KamriNoel channel.  \n\nBut it wasn't till this year that I found the perfect unicorn hairstyle tutorial to teach for all of you!  Out of all my Spooktorials, this one might be my very favorite!  \n\nI begin this Halloween hairstyle (which can easily be done as a DIY hairstyle) by parting her hair down the middle.  I then pulled each side into high ponytails, then divided the ponytail into two sections (one section with about 1/3 of the hair and one section with about 2/3 of the hair).  I straightened the 1/3 section of hair and left it down to fall next to her face and add some softness to her unicorn costume.  With the remaining 2/3 of hair I created a regular braid, pancaked the braid, and twisted it into a bun.  I used bobby pins to secure the braid into a bun.  Then repeated these steps on the other side of the head.  \n\nFor added effect with her unicorn look and awesome Halloween costume, I sprayed her hair with silver-colored hair spray and added some glitter to her part line.  Last, but not least, I added a beautiful silver unicorn horn circlet that I found online looking for halloween costume ideas.  \n\nHope you enjoy this hairstyle for halloween as much as I do! Please be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us which of all our Spooktorials is your favorite!\n\n💋's -Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, bobby pins, small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

I begin by creating a small inverse fishtail braid and then make it look even more amazing by working it to become a pancaked braid. Cute Girls Hairstyles has a fishtail braid tutorial and a french fishtail braid tutorial on their channel if you don't know how :)\n\nAfter finishing the fishtail braid, I pull some of the hair back to create a ponytail hairstyle and then secure the fishtail braid into the ponytail as well.  \n\nNow we are ready to create our half up half down bun.  \nUsing bobby pins I wrap the hair around the half up half down to create a half up bun shape.  \n\nNow begin creating a three strand braid on one side of your half up half down hairstyle.  I think this style looks even better with several braids so I added another braid on the second side of my hairstyle.
