I love the look of space buns, but those of us with short hair don't have enough hair length to pull those off. If we try, we are left with waterspout pigtails on top, which isn't what we want.\n\nSo several months ago I was playing around with my hair when I stumbled upon something that works very well, and is still cute! Moving the buns to the base of the head give you just enough length for a bun. I love Dutch Braids, because you can pancake them super pretty, to give you an added Boho, bohemian look.\n\nYou can dress this hairstyle up or down, depending on how you are dressed, and you can pretty much use any braid style as part of the combo.

My daughters have even done this hairstyle on each other since it's an easy hairstyle for kids to do!\nWhat makes this hairstyle simple is that you only need to know how to do a regular braid in order to create the great side braid look.  As this hairstyle is so easy, it is also quick which means that you can use this hairstyle as a great go-to for an easy hairstyle for school. \n\nTo begin this hairstyle you need to part off one small section of hair next to the ear.  Then divide this section into three smaller sections.  Pin two of the sections out of the way.  \n\nWith the free section of hair, begin a simple braid.  When you have the braid completed gently tug on one side of the braid to pop the edge of the braid outward.  Secure the braid with an elastic leaving the ends in the elastic to create a loop.  Use the loop and begin to roll the braid up into a bun.  \n\nSecure the bun against the head with bobby pins.  Repeat these steps with the other two braids to create a triangle shape of rosette looking buns.  \nThis easy hairstyle for girls is sure to impress and would love fabulous in so many settings!

So when I learned this version I knew I had to show others too!  This hairstyle tutorial is perfect for any occasion including a Homecoming dance hairstyle, a prom hairstyle, a simple every day hairstyle, or even an athletic hairstyle.\n\nBegin this hairstyle by creating a french braid on each side of the head.  I don't add in much hair and when I run out of hair at the end I simply secure with an elastic.  \n\nNow I take a small section of hair near the back of my head and add an elastic.  I like to poof this section to add some volume and fulness to my hairstyle.  This also gives me the base of the pull-thru braid.  \n\nCreate an entire pull thru braid with the remainer of the hair.  Be sure to pancake the hair as you go to add even more fullness!  Now I take the beginning french braids and lay them over the top of the pull thru. Use bobby pins to secure the braids to the back of your head.  \n\nOnce they are secure I roll the braid up and into a ball and tuck it under the braids to hide the ends.  Again use bobby pins to secure.  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHWrappedPullThru\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 6 small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

You will love this look for a prom hairstyle, a holiday party hairstyle, or even a romantic beach hairstyle look  \n\nTo recreate this DIY hairstyle tutorial you begin by creating a lace braid on the side of the head near the temple.  Only adding hair into the one side of the braid.  Then I go back and pancake the hair to add fullness and fluff.  \n\nOnce the lace braid is secure then I take the lace braid and another small piece of hair from the other side.  Secure them together.  \n\nFrom this point on you just need to take one piece of hair from each side, twist the hair, and then secure them with an elastic.  Go back and tug on the hair to loosen the twists and make it look so pretty and full.  \n\nThe ease comes from you only needing to use a few elastics and twists.  But the braid itself looks so amazing and beautiful.  It looks like a fancy french braid or a fax french braid.  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHElasticBraid\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan:\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium \n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

But there was something truly magical in the air when we filmed this unicorn hairstyle!  I've always wanted to try unicorn hair after being a little girl and being obsessed with My Little Pony :)  I've been so happy that My Little Pony and unicorns are coming back as current trends! \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHUnicornHair\n\nEvery year I love Halloween time, and Halloween 2016 is no exception!  There's something about the fall weather, the pumpkins and mums, football, and of course the Halloween costumes and Halloween makeup.  But I'm an especially big fan of creating amazing hairstyles for Halloween to go with our great costumes for Halloween!  Which is why we created this CGH Spooktorials series! \n\nI know that around this time of year everyone begins looking for hairstyle ideas for Halloween, DIY costumes ideas, last minute costumes, and Halloween makeup ideas.  So I thought I'd make it easy by continuing our Spooktorials and filming some great DIY Halloween videos, DIY costumes, and some great DIY hairstyles.  \n\nObviously we focus on the hairstyle tutorials on this channel, but you will be able to find lots of great DIYs, costume ideas, and other great Halloween-oriented videos between our channel, the BrooklynAndBailey channel, and the KamriNoel channel.  \n\nBut it wasn't till this year that I found the perfect unicorn hairstyle tutorial to teach for all of you!  Out of all my Spooktorials, this one might be my very favorite!  \n\nI begin this Halloween hairstyle (which can easily be done as a DIY hairstyle) by parting her hair down the middle.  I then pulled each side into high ponytails, then divided the ponytail into two sections (one section with about 1/3 of the hair and one section with about 2/3 of the hair).  I straightened the 1/3 section of hair and left it down to fall next to her face and add some softness to her unicorn costume.  With the remaining 2/3 of hair I created a regular braid, pancaked the braid, and twisted it into a bun.  I used bobby pins to secure the braid into a bun.  Then repeated these steps on the other side of the head.  \n\nFor added effect with her unicorn look and awesome Halloween costume, I sprayed her hair with silver-colored hair spray and added some glitter to her part line.  Last, but not least, I added a beautiful silver unicorn horn circlet that I found online looking for halloween costume ideas.  \n\nHope you enjoy this hairstyle for halloween as much as I do!

I begin by creating a small inverse fishtail braid and then make it look even more amazing by working it to become a pancaked braid. Cute Girls Hairstyles has a fishtail braid tutorial and a french fishtail braid tutorial on their channel if you don't know how :)\n\nAfter finishing the fishtail braid, I pull some of the hair back to create a ponytail hairstyle and then secure the fishtail braid into the ponytail as well.  \n\nNow we are ready to create our half up half down bun.  \nUsing bobby pins I wrap the hair around the half up half down to create a half up bun shape.  \n\nNow begin creating a three strand braid on one side of your half up half down hairstyle.  I think this style looks even better with several braids so I added another braid on the second side of my hairstyle.

I am not sure where the style originated, but recently Diane Kruger wore it to the 2014 Fashion Awards show.  One of our viewers, Gabi, even emailed me a photo for a much more relaxed version of this from Cosmopolitan magazine's website {http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a31363/hair-how-to-peek-a-boo-braid/}.  We decided to bump it up the list and finally film a tutorial on it.

Since my girls are totally loving pancake braids {braids that are flattened by tugging the elbows of the braids}, it was easy to convince them to try it...\n\nThis hairstyle uses the same Dutch braid pancaked technique we used here...\nhttp://youtu.be/Z_gQsa5Nd-c\n\nI did not pancake the Dutch portion of the braid, because this daughter has a little shorter hair and I needed the length for the flower.  My daughter wore this all day today, and received so many compliments!  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHDutchFlowerBraid\n\nYou can use the braided flower bun by itself, or in any number of combinations.  This hairstyle is perfect for weddings, formal occasions, flower girls, prom, homecoming, etc!  Enjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, one hair elastic, hairspray {if desired}, one small flower accessory for center of flower bun.\n\nTime Requirement: 7-10 minutes","date":"2012-06-11T01:34:25.000Z"},{"id":"Z_gQsa5Nd-c","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Z_gQsa5Nd-c/0.jpg","title":"Wrap-Around Dutch Pancake Braid | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

Fortunately, we actually filmed these Bohemian \"Pancake\" Braids that very same day, so here you go!\n\nWe used the Sock Curls as the base for this hairstyle, or you can use the Headband Curls as well, but if you have not seen how to create those gorgeous \"no-heat\" curls, you can see it here... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzJKdHglFck\n\nNow, this braiding technique is so simple and we call the resulting braids are \"Pancake Braids\".  My girls gave the name simply because the braids are flat like pancakes {kids are creative!}.  So, you have my girls to thank for the name!  You just create a normal 3-strand braid, braided loosely, and then go back and tug out the elbows in the braid {which flattens the braid} before securing with an elastic.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHPancakeBraids\n\nIn this hairstyle, we did two pancake braids from the front/sides and then brought them back and pinned them up to create this beautiful Bohemian look.  I promise you will get compliments on this hairstyle!\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2012-01-30T00:49:41.000Z"}]}
