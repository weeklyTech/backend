This Dutch Lace Braid Combo is the perfect style for you! Learn how to create these easy braids in just a few minutes by clicking above!\n\nInspiration for this hairstyle came from the show \"Vikings\" on the History Channel and my friend JennisHairDays on Instagram. To see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHDutchLaceCombo\n\nThis hairstyle uses a combination of a French Braid, Lace Braids (where you only pick up hair from the top), and simple 3-strand braids. You can add curls or waves to hair as a base, but I find that the braids pop more without the added texture. Just straight hair is fine.\n\nAs part of the step by step instructions, I added a quick back comb to the top section before French Braiding, to add volume to the braid, but you do not have to do so. On the Lace Braids, I wanted them to only add in hair from the top. (Although they look like Dutch Braids/Cornrows, they are in fact Lace Braids.) \n\nThis cute hair style will work on long hair and medium hair. It is perfect for girls of all ages as well, and holds up well during a long day of activity.\n\nI think this hairstyle is a beauty, all the while looking tough, too! I've seen variations of this hairstyle on Lagertha on the show Vikings, although she's added more rows of Lace Braids on the sides.\n\nPlease be sure to click the \"🔔\" next to the SUBSCRIBE button, to join our Notification Squad for #PowerHour each week, and leave a comment below telling me what you would like to see next!\n\n💋's -Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 3 hair elastics, hairspray or dry wax {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 8-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

Make sure to leave a little hair near the front of your head for later.  \n\nBegin a dutch fishtail braid adding in new hair near the top and then only using that hair near the bottom.  Secure with an elastic.\n\nNow go back and pick up the hair near the front of your face.  Divide it into three sections and create a dutch braid near your face and then continue a regular braid at the bottom.  Secure with an elastic.  \n\nPull all the loose hair from the other side of your head back and gather all hair except the small dutch braid into a ponytail near the nape of your neck.  Pancake the fishtail as needed.  \n\nTake the dutch braid and run it along the top of the fishtail braid and use bobby pins to attach it and create a stacked look. Secure the dutch braid to the hair with a clear elastic.  Only pull the hair through halfway the second time.  Take a section from the top of the loop and use a bobby pin to secure it and create a nice bun shape.  Repeat on the bottom until you have a perfect bun.  \n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hair elastics, bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: medium\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

This hairstyle is a perfect for a prom hairstyle, a date night hairstyle, a bohemian hairstyle for Coachella, or even just a fun back to school hairstyle!  I would love to see some of you use this style for prom hair!  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHDoubleDutchHalfUp\n\nBegin by parting hair slightly off to one side. On the heavy side of the hair part hair from the eyebrow back to the end of the part on the top of your head.  This should form a rectangle shape.  \n\nMove the rest of the hair out of the way.  With the piece you left out, make a diagonal part line to create two separate sections of hair.  \n\nWith the back section of hair begin a dutch braid.  When finished secure with an elastic.  Repeat this process with the front section.  \n\nNow take a piece of hair from the opposite side of the head and pull it back.  Combine this piece with the two dutch braids and secure them together with an elastic.  Remove any other elastics.  On the last loop of the elastic joining all the hair together only pull the hair halfway through.  Now use bobby pins to create a nice bun shape with the remaining hair.  Twist any ends around and into place and shape with bobby pins.  \n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

Who's excited??  I know I just love heart hairstyles.  I especially love when I find good heart hairstyles for kids and also heart hair that will work on teens/adults too! I think that this Valentine hair would be perfect for any romantic holiday...anniversary, wedding, fun Friday night date, etc..  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHHalfUpHeartBun\n\nTo begin this Valentine's day hairstyle start by pulling some of the top hair back into a ponytail near the crown.  Remember to keep the style soft and loose.  Take one of the remaining side pieces and begin to braid it.  Secure with an elastic and repeat on the other side.  Take both braids and secure them together directly under the ponytail.  This will help keep the elastic hidden.\n\nOn the original ponytail we are going to create a heart hair flip.  Create a small hole in the ponytail and flip the hair under and through the hole.  Secure that out of the way temporarily.  \n\nNow take two more side pieces and twist them back toward the back of the hair.  Loosen them a little to keep them soft.  Take them up and over the braids and bobby pin them.  \n\nLower the flip hair back down and divide it into two pieces.  Spray it a little with hairspray or wax to add a little stiffness.  You can also tease the pieces a little to add texture.  Begin to use these pieces to form the shape of a half heart.  Clip the loops down to help keep the separated as you secure them together at the point of the heart. \n\nReadjust any bobby pins that may be showing through and hair wrap the last elastic.  \n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hair elastics, bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

Begin creating a french braid on one side of the head.  You can pause about half way down the braid to pancake and create more volume and fullness. \n\nAt the nape of the neck take any remaining hair and secure into a ponytail.   Repeat this process on the other side until you have two secured ponytails at the nape of neck. \n\n Now create buns at the bottom of they hairstyle.

Add a dutch braid to the top section (you can pancake it if you want).  Add an elastic after you hit the bottom of the V to secure.  \n\nNow take two sections on the sides of the V and smooth them.  Pull them together with the dutch braid and secure them all together.  You can remove the second rubber band if the braid is too long.  \n\nNow begin to form a second ponytail below this first section of hair.  You will use these two pieces to form a pull thru braid.  Continue the pull thru braid all the way down the hair and then pancake it to make it extra full.  Secure the two ends together into one elastic at the bottom.  \n\nWith the tight braiding at the top and all the elastics down the pull thru braid, this briad is sure to stay in place and hold for a long time!  You will love this for gymnastics, dance, or other sports/athletics!  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHDutchPullThruCombo\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Katie\n\n\nFollow Katie!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/abellasbraids/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/charlieandabella/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abellasbraids\nBlog: https://abellasbraids.com/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hair elastics, clips to secure hair out of the way, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

So when I learned this version I knew I had to show others too!  This hairstyle tutorial is perfect for any occasion including a Homecoming dance hairstyle, a prom hairstyle, a simple every day hairstyle, or even an athletic hairstyle.\n\nBegin this hairstyle by creating a french braid on each side of the head.  I don't add in much hair and when I run out of hair at the end I simply secure with an elastic.  \n\nNow I take a small section of hair near the back of my head and add an elastic.  I like to poof this section to add some volume and fulness to my hairstyle.  This also gives me the base of the pull-thru braid.  \n\nCreate an entire pull thru braid with the remainer of the hair.  Be sure to pancake the hair as you go to add even more fullness!  Now I take the beginning french braids and lay them over the top of the pull thru. Use bobby pins to secure the braids to the back of your head.  \n\nOnce they are secure I roll the braid up and into a ball and tuck it under the braids to hide the ends.  Again use bobby pins to secure.  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHWrappedPullThru\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 6 small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

Go back and tug on the hair to loosen the twists and make it look so pretty and full.  \n\nThe ease comes from you only needing to use a few elastics and twists.

All of you received her so well, that we decided to invite her back with another BONUS video this week!\n\nToday Jill and one of her cute 6-yr-old twins, Brighton, will be showing us how to create a Dutch 3D Braid. This style is a perfect \"active\" hairstyle for sports, dance, gymanstics, cheer, etc, but can also be worn as a very cute everyday style!\n\nYou may want to try this braid on someone else before creating on yourself. Because you are working with 4 strands, and adding in hair on the sides, it may take a little practice to get the stranding down. What we can say, is that this braid is... BEAUTIFUL!\n\n{If you have thin hair, you can add grip and volume to it by using a texturizing iron.

I am not sure where the style originated, but recently Diane Kruger wore it to the 2014 Fashion Awards show.  One of our viewers, Gabi, even emailed me a photo for a much more relaxed version of this from Cosmopolitan magazine's website {http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/how-to/a31363/hair-how-to-peek-a-boo-braid/}.  We decided to bump it up the list and finally film a tutorial on it.

Learn how to create this Loop Waterfall Braid for a perfect hairstyle that your friends will adore! We'll teach you the EASIEST braid stitching for this braid possible, so that everyone can do it!\n\nOne of our viewers, Bethany, emailed us a photo of this style from Pinterest and by tracing back it looks like it was from a Russian website that I cannot read. It ended up being Shaun who figured out the braid technique just from looking at the picture for 15 seconds! I didn't believe him, but, yes, I have to eat my words!\n\nThe technique essentially entails creating a loop with one small strand of hair. Then reach through that loop and pull a new small section of hair half-way through a loop, and then flipping it upside down to create a new loop. Then repeating the process across the back of the head. Then you can go back and adjust the size of the loops later, to your liking.\n\nThis isn't a hairstyle that we would recommend for an active day, as the loops and bobby pins will fall out.

We've been friends with Linda Flowers, the Department Head of Hair & Makeup for both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire ever since we first put up the Katniss braid years ago. Since Linda had a contract for Dancing With The Stars, she was unable to work on the Mockingly movies, with Lionsgate instead hiring Camille Friend. Camille is just as talented, and her team did an amazing job trying to have the hair reflect the mood of the war-trodden State, as in the book.\n\nKatniss' braid in this 3rd movie isn't supposed to be focused so much on style, as her time in the Capitol and in the Games merited. This time around, Panem is at war, with a growing rebellion movement, and the look is supposed to fully reflect that. \n\nThings aren't as they once were, and that's why there is a fundamental change in the Katniss braid.\n\nKatniss still wears a side braid, which as Linda told us is to ensure that she doesn't snag her braid as she removes arrows from the quiver on her back. This time around, the wrapping braids from the left and right are French braids instead of Katniss' signature Dutch braid. For the side braid, the stitching looks very similar to a Simple braid, however it really is a chunky Reverse Fishtail. The look is also supposed to be somewhat messy and disheveled, which is the look we were going for. {The wind and rain in our trailer video shoot certainly helped with that!}\n\nTo see your own photo recreations featured in our app, feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle on IG with: #CGHMockingjayBraid\n\nHope you enjoyed this video, and if you did... please give it a big \"Thumbs Up\"!

This version uses simple braids, but you may also do this to French, Dutch, and Lace Braids.\n\nTo see your recreations featured in our CGH App, feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHHalfLoopBraidback\n\nThis style is categorized as \"Medium\" in skill level only because the skip-stitching can be confusing. Be sure to watch the video carefully to know when to bring back in a previously-feathered strand.\n\nDon't you think this is beautiful? On what occasions would you wear this?

Believe it or not, but the side version is my favorite!\n\nNow, because this is a winding knot, using only two strands, it can be very confusing to learn how to tie.  This is why I showed you how to tie the knot \"three\" times in the video, hoping that the repetition will help.\n\nI also show you a helpful tip which is useful in helping the knot to keep its shape, and to also help the falling strands lay flat.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nxoxo\n-Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, pomade, and hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 2-3 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFeel free to follow us on BlogLovin, where many YT Gurus have beauty blogs...\nhttp://www.bloglovin.com/blog/1815559\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic: It's Alright (acoustic)\nby Charity Vance (http://www.youtube.com/CharityVanceMusic)\niTunes Link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-me-ep/id818294153?uo=4&at=1l3v7Rs\nLicense: Personal emailed permission from Charity herself.","date":"2014-03-10T00:33:05.000Z"},{"id":"Fs6clS3fKbI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Fs6clS3fKbI/0.jpg","title":"Lace Braided Ponytail | Style-laboration with Lilith Moon","description":"Today's video is a Style-laboration {style collaboration} with Lilith Moon, one of my all-time favorite hair gurus on YouTube.

I love the French-Up High Bun, and since it was the style I wore for those two days with out electricity, we felt it appropriate to show you how to create it!\n\n{If you are careful CHG tutorial viewers, you will notice that this is the exact same tool that  Brooklyn used on me in the DisneyStyle video we posted a few months ago!

Then take the braids and twist them around each other, tying them off together with a hair elastic.\n\nWe added some volume to the hair before we made this braid, simply to add more texture to the hairstyle.

Here is the discount link: http://www.instyleroffer.com/topstyler\n\nWe uploaded our 1st version of the Katniss Braid several months before the movie came out.  Right after the movie premier, Linda Flowers, the lead hairstylist on The Hunger Games movie set, personally reached out to CuteGirlsHairstyles when she saw how popular our tutorial was!  Can you believe it... she reached out to US!!!\n\nLinda was so amazed at how iconic the Katniss Braid became, so much that teen girls were wearing the braid to see the movie in theaters!  She recognized that CuteGirlsHairstyles helped in teaching thousands of our fans how to do the braid! As such, Linda offered to give me a \"personal\" tutorial of the many Hunger Games hairstyles over Skype!\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHTrueKatnissBraid\n\nDuring our tutorial, I quickly saw that Katniss' style had a little more to it than what I had originally thought!  Linda showed me how she added the texture into Jennifer Lawrence's hair \"before\" she created the Katniss braid {something I had not figured out}.  She uses a tool called the TopStyler® {by InStyler®} to add volume and stranded twists into the diagonal Dutch braid.  I show you how to do this in the tutorial.\n\nYou can find the TopStyler at Target, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ulta, or online at the following link...\n\nhttp://www.topstyler.com/\n\nI appreciate that the TopStyler uses a slow and uniform transfer heat to curl the hair, rather than the immediate hot heat a curling wand provides that only heats the outside of the strand.\n\nThis is the exact look Katniss wore throughout the arena scenes in the movie, taught to CuteGirlsHairstyles personally by the one who created it... Linda Flowers!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFTC Disclosure:  I was provided this TopStyler® tool free of charge by InStyler® for review purposes only.
