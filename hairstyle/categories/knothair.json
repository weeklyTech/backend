The Celtic Knot.\n\nTag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHCelticKnots\n\nThe Celtic Knot has been around for centuries, traditionally used to adorn religious sculptures and various kinds of artwork.

Brooklyn just used her NuMe curling wand to achieve the curls.  \n\nHere we show you three versions, a Single Celtic Knot, a Double Celtic Knot, and a Side Celtic Knot.  Believe it or not, but the side version is my favorite!\n\nNow, because this is a winding knot, using only two strands, it can be very confusing to learn how to tie.  This is why I showed you how to tie the knot \"three\" times in the video, hoping that the repetition will help.\n\nI also show you a helpful tip which is useful in helping the knot to keep its shape, and to also help the falling strands lay flat.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nxoxo\n-Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, pomade, and hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 2-3 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFeel free to follow us on BlogLovin, where many YT Gurus have beauty blogs...\nhttp://www.bloglovin.com/blog/1815559\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic: It's Alright (acoustic)\nby Charity Vance (http://www.youtube.com/CharityVanceMusic)\niTunes Link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-me-ep/id818294153?uo=4&at=1l3v7Rs\nLicense: Personal emailed permission from Charity herself.","date":"2014-03-10T00:33:05.000Z"},{"id":"N1I3UVVkYdw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/N1I3UVVkYdw/0.jpg","title":"The Knotted Pullback | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"We wanted to show you another 3-minute hairstyle that is different enough from a simple pullback that your friends will wonder how you did it!\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHKnottedPullback\n\nThe style uses a simple knotting technique that is easy to put in and easy to take out.

So... my husband called to tell me that bad news and asked me what I thought he should do!  Guess what I said???  Yep... \"Film a Daddy 'Do!\"\n\nThis hairstyle is not one we recommend if you are going to be active all day, but for more formal occasions or days when you are just simply going out, walking around, or at church, it is a simple yet very beautiful hairstyle! \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHSquareKnotPullback\n\nCheck out my hubby's other Daddy 'Do hairstyles here...\nTriple-Flipped Ponytail {hhttp://youtu.be/zBJAHfrix2I}\nFour Twist Ponytail {http://youtu.be/mKSAp9V3hcM}\nSimple Braid {http://youtu.be/_GwFGqN3PNE}\n\nThe \"Twistbacks into Square Knot\" tutorial is my husband's creation, and I actually think he did a very good job on it... what do you think? ¬†{I am, however, going to have to talk to him about what he's been feeding our kids!}\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, pomade, 1 large hair elastic, 2-3 small bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic:\nYellow Carousel\nby Olive Musique\nSource Link:  http://tinyurl.com/YellowCarousel\nhttp://www.premiumbeat.com/license  (Standard)","date":"2012-09-23T23:31:27.000Z"},{"id":"8UHgEgyzd9U","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/8UHgEgyzd9U/0.jpg","title":"The Knotted Headband | Bangs or Fringe | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

This knotted headband style was sent in by a fan from St. Petersburg, Russia and we loved it!\n\nIf you know how to do the first step of tying your shoe, you can do this braid!  It is created with essentially overlapping square knots.  I start with the hair wet, and use a little pomade... when the hair dries, the loops of the knots spread a little and look gorgeous!  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHKnottedHeadband\n\nThis braid is perfect for dancers, cheerleaders, or just wearing around town or with a combo for a dance or formal occasion!  It is also great for women of all ages!  We have worn this on my #4 daughter with short hair, and is a braid you can do on yourself as well!  I guarantee you will certainly receive lots of compliments on this hairstyle!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, pomade, 1 small hair elastic, 1-2 bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic:\nYellow Carousel\nby Olive Musique\nSource Link:  http://tinyurl.com/YellowCarousel\nhttp://www.premiumbeat.com/license  (Standard)","date":"2012-08-06T04:16:41.000Z"},{"id":"pYGrnOiqSDI","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/pYGrnOiqSDI/0.jpg","title":"French Knotted Braid | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

After completing the two simple knots on top, as you finish of the side ponytail... you can do it as a bun, braid (regular or fishtail), many braids, curls, or regular ponytail (as I did here).
