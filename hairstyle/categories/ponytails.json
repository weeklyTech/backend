Add a dutch braid to the top section (you can pancake it if you want).  Add an elastic after you hit the bottom of the V to secure.  \n\nNow take two sections on the sides of the V and smooth them.  Pull them together with the dutch braid and secure them all together.  You can remove the second rubber band if the braid is too long.  \n\nNow begin to form a second ponytail below this first section of hair.  You will use these two pieces to form a pull thru braid.  Continue the pull thru braid all the way down the hair and then pancake it to make it extra full.  Secure the two ends together into one elastic at the bottom.  \n\nWith the tight braiding at the top and all the elastics down the pull thru braid, this briad is sure to stay in place and hold for a long time!  You will love this for gymnastics, dance, or other sports/athletics!  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHDutchPullThruCombo\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Katie\n\n\nFollow Katie!\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/abellasbraids/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/charlieandabella/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/abellasbraids\nBlog: https://abellasbraids.com/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hair elastics, clips to secure hair out of the way, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

We then gathered the two sides up in to high pigtails. Next, we added temporary pink colored hairspray to the bottom edges of Brooklyn's right side, then blue-colored hairspray the the left.

A fan emailed us the lace braid ponytail photo from Pinterest over a year ago and we filmed a tutorial on CGH#3 at that time.  I didn't like the lighting, since we were working on a new camera back then.  So, we re-filmed it the week before we moved, and here it is!  I like it much better!\n\nBrooklyn and I show you the \"cheat\" in this hairstyle in that you do not actually Lace Braid all the way down the ponytail.  Every time the braid wraps under the ponytail, I just did 3-4 stitches of a regular braid and then wrapped it around, picking back up with the Lace Braid on the side.  You can't tell and it makes the braid much easier to do!\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 2 bobby pins, 1 large hair band, 1 small hair elastic, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

We have seen photos on Pinterest of this style, but I did not know how to create one.\n\nAs you know, the stitches on a standard Fishtail Braid have a \"v\" pattern.  Well, a Reverse {or Inverse} Fishtail Braid has a \"^\" pattern which is very different than what you see around.\n\nI spent a few hours last week practicing on my mannequin head, and as I completed the first five stitches or so, it seemed like I was doing something wrong! Just when I figured I would give up, all of the sudden... the braid popped out!  A beautiful inverse herringbone pattern!\n\nI then recreated it on CGH#3, and had her show Bailey, her older sister.  Bailey quickly asked... \"How did you do that?  I want to learn it!\"  So, last week, we were pretty much wearing reverse fishtail braids every day!\n\nHope you enjoy, and if you do... please feel free to share!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 1 hair band, 1 small hair elastic, hairspray and accessory {if desired}. \n\nTime Requirement: 5-8 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?
