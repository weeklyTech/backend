I'd completely forgotten about it until my friend @Braidsandstyles12 recently recreated it on IG.

If you have thick hair, I'd suggest doing two braids, side by side, instead of one... as the infinity strand can can get super thick fast!\n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHInfinityCombo\n\nKamri has been wearing this a lot lately, and receives so many compliments on it.

Because the first few stitches are the ABSOLUTE hardest, we decided to film a tutorial for you and try and make it as clear as we can. {CGH3 volunteered to be my model.}\n\nThere are a few nice photos of this braid technique floating around on Pinterest and Instagram, so this isn't new but a braid. {I first saw it on a Spanish tutorial by Diana Rojas on YouTube, back in July, 2013.} What we can say, is that this braid does draw a lot of attention, especially when worn in a combo!\n\nWe imagine this as being a perfect updo hairstyle for a Prom, Homecoming, or any other formal. YOU... ARE... GONNA... LOVE... IT!\n\nMy first big tip is to wet down the hair before braiding. For braids that involve multiples of strands, we find that this helps the braid look more clean and crisp.\n\nAs you braid, you may find a few \"sharks\" {parts where the hair sticks up like a shark fin in water} will appear.  Simply comb them towards the braid and tuck them under it, to help hide them.\n\nCGH3 has worn this a few times now, and the girls at her school were taking photos of them on their phones.  The photos spread to older sisters who then showed my twins at their Junior High.  They thought it was funny how fast it spread!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 1 hairband, 3-5 bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 8-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Hard\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nDon't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFeel free to follow us on BlogLovin, where many YT Gurus have beauty blogs...\nhttp://www.bloglovin.com/blog/1815559\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic: Two Birds\nby Charity Vance (http://www.youtube.com/CharityVanceMusic)\niTunes Link:  https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/two-birds-single/id396263275\nLicense: Personal emailed permission from Charity herself.","date":"2014-01-13T01:02:58.000Z"},{"id":"EGbUXBi7DHk","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/EGbUXBi7DHk/0.jpg","title":"How to Create a Diagonal Bow Braid","description":"Be the first to check out our tutorial of Elsa's Textured French Braid from Disney's new movie \"Frozen\".

It looks like a variation of the Katniss braid, but with some hair down in the back.\n\nTaking a quick look at the photo, we could tell that it was a winding braid, using a lace braid along the partline and forehead. Then, right about the right temple, the braid turns into a Dutch braid until just behind the right ear, then back into a lace braid diagonally around the back {allowing for hair down}.  The braid is then finished into a simple braid that can be worn down in the back or over the shoulder.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHWrapAroundPrimBraid\n\nFor another super-cute look, you could continue the diagonal braid as a Dutch braid instead of a lace braid... giving your a beautiful variation of the Katniss braid from the original movie and Catching Fire!  \n\nIf you would like us to do more \"Catching Fire\" hairstyles, simply let us know in the comment box below!

It was probably the most unique and cute hairstyle I have seen since the Waterfall Braid! So... I sat down to figure it out, but after many attempts I wasn't having any luck.  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHBowBraid\n\nAs another fan knew I was looking into the braid technique, she posted a picture on our Facebook page with a link to a Russian YouTube video showing the exact technique. The video is not very good quality and at times difficult to follow, but it gave me just enough information to be able to master the braid!  Now it is time to share with you all everything I learned!\n\nThere are endless possibilities with this bow braid hairstyle... short hair, medium hair, long hair, layered hair, hair with bangs, combos, etc.  I show you in the video finished hairstyles using the bow braid and adapting it to a braided headband, diagonal braid, lace braid, or even ponytails.  Any style that contains a regular 3 strand French braid could be transformed with bows to become \"The Bow Braid\" version!!!  {What a unique and super cute way to spice up a traditional French Braid!}  \n\nItems Needed:  A brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, hairspray or pomade, a hairpin (not a bobby pin), and a few hair elastics.\n\nTime Requirement:  10-15 minutes, depending on the hairstyle you choose.\n\nIn the video you see that I mixed in the tails of the bows back into the next strand.  You may find it easier and less \"messy\" to simply lay the tail alongside the French Braid and then bring down the next section of hair for the next loop.  As you finish the braid, most of the tails will be covered by the hair from the top.  It all depends on how you want the bow braid to look.\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2012-05-10T01:00:15.000Z"},{"id":"a__cEIT55FM","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/a__cEIT55FM/0.jpg","title":"Side Fishtail Bun | Updos | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

Since this is prom season, we decided to finally film this hairstyle for all of you.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHSideFishtailBun\n\nIf you do not know how to fishtail braid, please see our easy step-by-step video here first...\nhttp://tinyurl.com/howtofishtail\n\nBefore the tutorial, I slightly curled the top layer of the hair only, using a curling wand, leaving the underneath layers as is.  I then gathered all of the hair to the side by the right ear and created the fishtail braid.\n\nOnce the braid was finished, I secured it with the hair elastic and tugged on the sides of the braid just to make the braid appear more loose.  Then I rolled the braid up into a bun and pinned it just behind the ear.  \n\nTo avoid having to use so many bobby pins, I used 3 Goody Spin Pins.  These pins are the perfect solution for holding hair buns together all day!  I figure that each spin pin saves you from having to use 2-3 bobby pins, and they come in colors to match your hair type.  If you would like to purchase Goody Spin Pins, you can find them at Wal-Mart, Target, Sally's, etc.  You can also find them on Amazon here... \n\nhttp://amzn.to/1Tck00N\n\nThis braided updo hairstyle is perfect for prom, homecoming, weddings, or on days when you simply want to wear a very unique, but cute, hair bun! I think it turned out very cute!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFTC Disclosure:  This is not a paid review of the Goody¬Æ Spin Pin.  I purchased these myself and use them in my hair bun tutorials.

I wrote about my admiration for single moms, information about the scholarship program, and added a link where you can donate (if you can), here...\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/SingleMomScholarships\n\nNow, we have used the Lady Gaga Hair Bow for awhile and are just now getting around to filming a tutorial for it.  We love how it looks, and many fans have been asking for us to film how to do this hairstyle.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHGagaHairBow\n\nI uses a high ponytail on top of the head, and one hairband and a 6-7 bobby pins to complete the hair bow.  It is really simple, and looks so super cute!  Everyone will ask you how you do the Lady Gaga hair bow!

Some variations use a ponytail on top from which you pull strands into the crown braid.  I do not particularly like that version as it leave a hole on the top of the head, and a bump as well.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHCrownBraid\n\nThe Crown Braid uses the Dutch Braiding technique, but you pull the hair in on top only from the front.  This is what makes the style look so clean, and allows for the braid to pop out.  This style is perfect for formal occasions, prom, homecoming, graduation, baptism, communion, weddings, etc.  It is particularly great for cheer, gymnastics, ballet, and other sports.
