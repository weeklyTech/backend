You can do this easy hairstyle for long hair or as an easy hairstyle for medium hair.  I've used this braided bun hairstyle on myself as an easy DIY hairstyle or on my daughters!  My daughters have even done this hairstyle on each other since it's an easy hairstyle for kids to do!\nWhat makes this hairstyle simple is that you only need to know how to do a regular braid in order to create the great side braid look.  As this hairstyle is so easy, it is also quick which means that you can use this hairstyle as a great go-to for an easy hairstyle for school. \n\nTo begin this hairstyle you need to part off one small section of hair next to the ear.  Then divide this section into three smaller sections.  Pin two of the sections out of the way.  \n\nWith the free section of hair, begin a simple braid.  When you have the braid completed gently tug on one side of the braid to pop the edge of the braid outward.  Secure the braid with an elastic leaving the ends in the elastic to create a loop.  Use the loop and begin to roll the braid up into a bun.  \n\nSecure the bun against the head with bobby pins.  Repeat these steps with the other two braids to create a triangle shape of rosette looking buns.  \nThis easy hairstyle for girls is sure to impress and would love fabulous in so many settings!

This easy hairstyle still has a sophisticated look to it that you can wear to work or other dressier events.  \n\nThe second headband hairstyle is two stacked fishtails.

If you don't want to stack the braids simply do two fishtails for a similar effect.  \n\nThe third hairstyle is a cute sporty pull thru ponytail.

This hairstyle is perfect for the mornings you want your daughters to look amazing, but don't want to spend an hour doing their hairstyle.  \n\nIn this #CGHCrissCrossPigtails video we take dutch braids and mix them with two pigtails to create an adorable twist to an otherwise boring braided hairstyle.  \n\nThis hairstyle is certainly a perfect style for toddlers, but it would also work well as a teen style for girls running off to an athletic class and in need of an athletic hairstyle.  It would also work well for a gym hairstyle, or even dance hairstyle or gymnastics hairstyle.  This is an all around amazing hairstyle!  \n\nWe begin by parting the hair in the middle of the head.  Then dividing the hairstyle into four section.  Dutch braid the top two sections closest to the front of the face and then using a regular braid cross it over in the back to the opposite side of head.  Then secure all the hair together creating an X pattern into the two pigtails.\n\nSimply add a few straightener curls to the ends of the pigtails for a little added cuteness and you are ready to go!\n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHCrissCrossPigtails\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Abby\n\nFollow Abby!

But there was something truly magical in the air when we filmed this unicorn hairstyle!  I've always wanted to try unicorn hair after being a little girl and being obsessed with My Little Pony :)  I've been so happy that My Little Pony and unicorns are coming back as current trends! \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHUnicornHair\n\nEvery year I love Halloween time, and Halloween 2016 is no exception!  There's something about the fall weather, the pumpkins and mums, football, and of course the Halloween costumes and Halloween makeup.  But I'm an especially big fan of creating amazing hairstyles for Halloween to go with our great costumes for Halloween!  Which is why we created this CGH Spooktorials series! \n\nI know that around this time of year everyone begins looking for hairstyle ideas for Halloween, DIY costumes ideas, last minute costumes, and Halloween makeup ideas.  So I thought I'd make it easy by continuing our Spooktorials and filming some great DIY Halloween videos, DIY costumes, and some great DIY hairstyles.  \n\nObviously we focus on the hairstyle tutorials on this channel, but you will be able to find lots of great DIYs, costume ideas, and other great Halloween-oriented videos between our channel, the BrooklynAndBailey channel, and the KamriNoel channel.  \n\nBut it wasn't till this year that I found the perfect unicorn hairstyle tutorial to teach for all of you!  Out of all my Spooktorials, this one might be my very favorite!  \n\nI begin this Halloween hairstyle (which can easily be done as a DIY hairstyle) by parting her hair down the middle.  I then pulled each side into high ponytails, then divided the ponytail into two sections (one section with about 1/3 of the hair and one section with about 2/3 of the hair).  I straightened the 1/3 section of hair and left it down to fall next to her face and add some softness to her unicorn costume.  With the remaining 2/3 of hair I created a regular braid, pancaked the braid, and twisted it into a bun.  I used bobby pins to secure the braid into a bun.  Then repeated these steps on the other side of the head.  \n\nFor added effect with her unicorn look and awesome Halloween costume, I sprayed her hair with silver-colored hair spray and added some glitter to her part line.  Last, but not least, I added a beautiful silver unicorn horn circlet that I found online looking for halloween costume ideas.  \n\nHope you enjoy this hairstyle for halloween as much as I do! Please be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us which of all our Spooktorials is your favorite!\n\n💋's -Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, bobby pins, small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

I was worried about the tattoo breaking apart when we applied it, but it seemed to hold up well.\n\nAfter we placed the tattoo where we wanted it, Kamri and I decided to add in a cute tieback to the hair so that the tattoo popped and became more like an accessory.

We've watched Prim grow up, from a little girl with side braids into a beautiful young woman who works to take care of injured patients in a hospital.\n\nPrim's braided hairstyles have matured right along with her, as we see in this tutorial. \n\nWe know that Prim needs her hair out of her face, and pinned back out of the way, so that she can care for her patients. The best way to do this would be with an updo!, And, typical to Prim's affinity for signature braids, just like Katniss, she keeps braids as the base for her updo. \n\nThis is a very easy updo to create, and it gives a very sophisticated look especially when worn slicked back.

The style is also unbelievably easy to recreate once you learn the twisting patterns! \n\n💋's  \n-Mindy\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 1 ponytail holder, 1 small hair elastic, hairspray and accessory {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit... http://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n____________________________\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial every Sunday night {7pm CST}! \n\nSo, please don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n____________________________\n\nMusic: For You\nby Max Brodie\nLink: http://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty_free_music/songs/for-you-3\nLicense: #419255 Non-exclusive STANDARD","date":"2014-09-15T00:01:09.000Z"},{"id":"_drvG1d3tak","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_drvG1d3tak/0.jpg","title":"Mermaid Half Braid Tutorial | Cute Hairstyles","description":"Be sure to Like us on Facebook! http://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nThe contest has ended, and prize awarded. Our Waterfall Twists into Mermaid Braid {http://youtu.be/Gc7p8IVVzbM} did so well back in May 2013, that we decided go for another mermaid braid look today!\n\nThis one is a half-up-half-down hairstyle with gorgeous definition in its stranding! A Mermaid Braid works just the same as a Lace Braid, however you are adding strands in on \"both\" sides of the braid, instead of just one. {You can think of it as an extremely fine stranded, but loose French Braid.}\n\nI wouldn't recommend this style for anyone being very \"active\" throughout the day, such as PE, dance, or other athletics. This would be worn more for casual wear. Trust us, we have tried!\n\nIf you want to see your recreation photos featured in our CGH App, please feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHMermaidHalfBraid\n\nYou can carry the mermaid stranding all the way down the braid, if you would like, but we stopped half way because we loved the look! It is just a matter of personal preference.\n\nKamri has worn this Mermaid Half Braid a few times over the past several months, and her friends absolutely love it! She even said that a few boys commented on it, which is a huge shocker coming from boys her age!\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nFor the giveaway, there is a total of 18 entries possible {however only 1 is required, and it's easy peasy}!

It heats up super fast as well.  {Be sure to use heat protector any time you use heat on your hair!}\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHNumeCurls\n\nI will often add texture before I do other hairstyles on myself {braids, twists, buns, etc} and I always get compliments from other moms.  I found mine in a kiosk at the mall after advice from my fellow YouTuber friend Jenny (http://www.youtube.com/ShowMeCute}.  You can also buy the NuMe directly from the company at the following link...\n\nhttp://www.numeonline.com/shop/\n\nItems Needed: NuMe curling wand, heat protectant, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement:  10 minutes.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nFTC Disclosure:  I purchased my first curling wand and flat iron on my own, however NuMe® has provided me with another curling wand free of charge for review purposes only.

Repeat steps 3 and 4 all the way around the back of the head and towards the top of the left ear.\n6.

Start with wet, brushed hair...\n\n2. Make five ponytails down the center of the head, starting with a section in front and work your way back, secure them with bands. {Make sure that the hair in the ponytails are as equal as possible, so that the buns are relatively the same size.}\n\n3. Take the first ponytail and being twisting the hair strand until it wants to twist around itself, gently allowing it to twist around the ponytail holder into a bun, and secure with another hairband.\n\n4. Repeat Step 3 for the other four ponytails.\n\n5. Lightly spritz hairspray to help secure any flyways.\n\n{If you have problems with thin hair or baby flyways, you may want to try a little pomade or hair fiber gum to help hold in the twisty buns, but this is completely optional.}\n\nFind many more hairstyles by visiting our website:\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com","date":"2012-03-05T01:13:14.000Z"},{"id":"oFlWXEV7qp0","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/oFlWXEV7qp0/0.jpg","title":"Single French {Braid} Back | Short Hair | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

I even had one fan ask over 10 friends to all email within a few hours each asking for this style!  Now, that is determination!

Begin with dry slightly messy or curly hair.  {You can use a flat iron or wand to add a little curl to the top layer if needed}.  \n2.  Pull all hair loosely to one side over your shoulder.\n3.  Braid the hair using the regular braiding method.\n4.  Tug on the elbows of the braid to loosen/flatten and soften the braid.\n5.  Curl any loose pieces of hair to frame your face.  Remember it's supposed to be MESSY!  \n6.  Bobby pin any problem strands into place.\n\nHope you enjoy!","date":"2012-02-05T23:30:18.000Z"},{"id":"XUo47UiPh3Y","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/XUo47UiPh3Y/0.jpg","title":"Pancake Braids w/ Sock Curls | Bohemian Hair | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

There are likely 101 ways to do this braid... pinching off with a rubber band after the French just above the ear, braiding through as I have done (with a bobby pin tuck), tucking the braid behind the ear, etc.  It all is a matter of preference and hair length.  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHFrontFrenchBraid\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2009-10-29T21:24:20.000Z"},{"id":"u_xJAHKzeUw","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/u_xJAHKzeUw/0.jpg","title":"How to Get Flat-Iron Curls | Curly Hair | Cute Girls Hairstyles","description":"To see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

Yes, you can curl with a FLAT IRON!!!  Be sure to use a good heat protectant first!  This style works alone or with any combo of hair techniques (braids, buns, twists, flips, topsy's, etc).  This is very simply and helps the hair look more volumenous with an elegant style.  This hairdo can be for moms, teens, and tweens as well!  \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHFlatIronCurls\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2009-10-23T14:46:14.000Z"}]}
