You can do this easy hairstyle for long hair or as an easy hairstyle for medium hair.  I've used this braided bun hairstyle on myself as an easy DIY hairstyle or on my daughters!  My daughters have even done this hairstyle on each other since it's an easy hairstyle for kids to do!\nWhat makes this hairstyle simple is that you only need to know how to do a regular braid in order to create the great side braid look.  As this hairstyle is so easy, it is also quick which means that you can use this hairstyle as a great go-to for an easy hairstyle for school. \n\nTo begin this hairstyle you need to part off one small section of hair next to the ear.  Then divide this section into three smaller sections.  Pin two of the sections out of the way.  \n\nWith the free section of hair, begin a simple braid.  When you have the braid completed gently tug on one side of the braid to pop the edge of the braid outward.  Secure the braid with an elastic leaving the ends in the elastic to create a loop.  Use the loop and begin to roll the braid up into a bun.  \n\nSecure the bun against the head with bobby pins.  Repeat these steps with the other two braids to create a triangle shape of rosette looking buns.  \nThis easy hairstyle for girls is sure to impress and would love fabulous in so many settings!

In this video I will show you three simply and easy hairstyles for wearing headbands.  Pair any of these hairstyles with a cute sweater or jacket and you are ready for the day!\n\nThe first headband hairstyle is a darling bun wrapped with a braid.  This easy hairstyle still has a sophisticated look to it that you can wear to work or other dressier events.  \n\nThe second headband hairstyle is two stacked fishtails.

I LOVE the way these simple french braids combine with buns to create an easy, but flawless look.  Pair this DIY hairstyle sweater and prepare for compliments!  \n\nBegin by parting your hair into two even sections.  Secure one section out of the way. Add dry shampoo for more volume.  Begin creating a french braid on one side of the head.  You can pause about half way down the braid to pancake and create more volume and fullness. \n\nAt the nape of the neck take any remaining hair and secure into a ponytail.   Repeat this process on the other side until you have two secured ponytails at the nape of neck. \n\n Now create buns at the bottom of they hairstyle.  You do this by only pulling the hair half way thru the last wrap of the elastic.  Then bobby pin the top half up into a crescent shape.  Roll the bottom hair up and again pin into place to create a full bun shape.

So when I learned this version I knew I had to show others too!  This hairstyle tutorial is perfect for any occasion including a Homecoming dance hairstyle, a prom hairstyle, a simple every day hairstyle, or even an athletic hairstyle.\n\nBegin this hairstyle by creating a french braid on each side of the head.  I don't add in much hair and when I run out of hair at the end I simply secure with an elastic.  \n\nNow I take a small section of hair near the back of my head and add an elastic.  I like to poof this section to add some volume and fulness to my hairstyle.  This also gives me the base of the pull-thru braid.  \n\nCreate an entire pull thru braid with the remainer of the hair.  Be sure to pancake the hair as you go to add even more fullness!  Now I take the beginning french braids and lay them over the top of the pull thru. Use bobby pins to secure the braids to the back of your head.  \n\nOnce they are secure I roll the braid up and into a ball and tuck it under the braids to hide the ends.  Again use bobby pins to secure.  \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHWrappedPullThru\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"👍🏻\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us...\n\n💋's -Jordan\n\nFollow Jordan!\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-OgCPLZLQI11uMiZT1aaag\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/braidsbyjordan/\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 6 small hair elastics, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial or Behind the Braids family vlog every Sunday night.

Learn how to create this Loop Waterfall Braid for a perfect hairstyle that your friends will adore! We'll teach you the EASIEST braid stitching for this braid possible, so that everyone can do it!\n\nOne of our viewers, Bethany, emailed us a photo of this style from Pinterest and by tracing back it looks like it was from a Russian website that I cannot read. It ended up being Shaun who figured out the braid technique just from looking at the picture for 15 seconds! I didn't believe him, but, yes, I have to eat my words!\n\nThe technique essentially entails creating a loop with one small strand of hair. Then reach through that loop and pull a new small section of hair half-way through a loop, and then flipping it upside down to create a new loop. Then repeating the process across the back of the head. Then you can go back and adjust the size of the loops later, to your liking.\n\nThis isn't a hairstyle that we would recommend for an active day, as the loops and bobby pins will fall out. The Loop Waterfall is simply beautiful hairstyle for those days when you just want to wear something gorgeous! \n\nTo see your own photo recreations featured in our app, feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle on IG with: #CGHLoopWaterfall\n\nYou can use the Loop Waterfall as part of a combo, even updos, which makes it perfect for Prom or Homecoming!\n\nI PROMISE... you will receive compliments ALL DAY when wearing this hairstyle! Not only will they love how it looks, but they'll also want to know how you did it!

Our Waterfall Twists into Mermaid Braid {http://youtu.be/Gc7p8IVVzbM} did so well back in May 2013, that we decided go for another mermaid braid look today!\n\nThis one is a half-up-half-down hairstyle with gorgeous definition in its stranding! A Mermaid Braid works just the same as a Lace Braid, however you are adding strands in on \"both\" sides of the braid, instead of just one. {You can think of it as an extremely fine stranded, but loose French Braid.}\n\nI wouldn't recommend this style for anyone being very \"active\" throughout the day, such as PE, dance, or other athletics. This would be worn more for casual wear. Trust us, we have tried!\n\nIf you want to see your recreation photos featured in our CGH App, please feel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHMermaidHalfBraid\n\nYou can carry the mermaid stranding all the way down the braid, if you would like, but we stopped half way because we loved the look! It is just a matter of personal preference.\n\nKamri has worn this Mermaid Half Braid a few times over the past several months, and her friends absolutely love it! She even said that a few boys commented on it, which is a huge shocker coming from boys her age!\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nFor the giveaway, there is a total of 18 entries possible {however only 1 is required, and it's easy peasy}!

Now it has come full circle! {@AnniesForgetMeKnots also posted a beautiful variation of this braid!}\n\nWe love tiebacks because they are very mature looking, and can be worn with straight, wavy, or curly hair as the base. I promise, you will receive so many compliments on this one!\n\nUsing the Loop Braid technique, which incorporates skip-stitching of feathers strands from the braid, you can dress up any braid.

What may be easy for one fan, may be difficult for another. We always keep that in mind when making our list of future styles.\n\n{One problem for our lack of shorty styles on CGH is that without extra hair, many of our hairstyles may not work on short hair. We also only have one daughter, Rylan, with short hair, and she doesn't particularly enjoy her hair being done as much as the other girls. We have to respect that.} \n\nContrary to what you may think, pigtails are not just for little girls. Pay careful attention to the video, where I show you a few tips to help you get a more beautiful, mature look to this everyday style!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 2 small hair elastics, hairspray and accessory {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\nTo see step-by-step instructions and more photos of this style, please visit... http://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial every Sunday night {7pm CST}! \n\nSo, please don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://bit.ly/VovoC9\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\nFollow CGH on Twitter:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\n\nFollow CGH on Pinterest, and see my \"Try\" board...\nhttp://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\nFollow CGH on Instagram and see unpublished photos of our family:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\n\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\nMusic: The Summer Song\nby Max Brodie \nhttp://www.premiumbeat.com/royalty_free_music/songs/the-summer-song\nLicense: #405026 Non-exclusive STANDARD","date":"2014-07-28T00:06:35.000Z"}]}
