So many of you have been asking for a tutorial on how I create them, and they are really easy.\n\nI section off my hair into three layers, bottom, middle, and top, and then use a 25mm curling wand, curling each strand \"away\" from my face. I hold the hair there for a few seconds, then release the wand and tug the hair strand a bit just to give the curl some length.\n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHWandCurls\n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"üëçüèª\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us if you think Brooklyn should do a DIY hairstyle soon!\n\nüíã's -Bailey\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 25mm curling wand, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 7-10 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\n___\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial every Sunday night {7pm CST}! \n\nSo, please don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CuteGirlsHairstyles?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/CuteGirlHair\nInstagram: http://www.Instagram.com/CuteGirlsHairstyles\nPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/MrsHairdo\n\n___\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.","date":"2016-02-08T01:09:44.000Z"},{"id":"W0jWvowYD7k","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/W0jWvowYD7k/0.jpg","title":"No-Heat Plopping Curls | Back-to-School Hairstyles","description":"It has been a few months since our last no-heat curls tutorial, so we wanted to show you another one today that is perfect for Back to School!\n\nThese are called Plopping Curls {or Plunking Curls}, obviously because you plop your hair into a t-shirt, and then tie them up.

For this tutorial, it is a t-shirt creating the curls.\n\nBe sure to start with your hair slightly more than damp, not \"dripping\" wet. If the hair is too wet, your curls will not turn out.

This is an updated variation of our Pancake Braids w/Sock Curls tutorial that we put up years ago {http://youtu.be/XUo47UiPh3Y}.\n\nWe began by curling Brooklyn's hair with a wand, and helping set the curls with hairspray. For the accents, you can use any type of braids you want, but I feel the best are Dutch Fishtails and 3-strand Dutch Braids. {This is because they pancake the best.} For this tutorial, and for the sake of time, we used Dutch Braids here.\n\nThe twins are not going to Prom this year, since they have chosen to not date until they are 16, but they are helping several of their upper classmate girls to do their hair for the night! \n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this style featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHBraidedHalfUp\n\nThis would also make a wonderful Festival Hairstyle, something you could wear to Coachella or a medieval or renaissance fair.

The challenge with no heat, is how do you obtain gorgeous curls without heat?\n\nWell, we have already shown you how to create No-Heat Headband Curls:\nhttp://youtu.be/0Rdfgu3zqY4\n\nAnd we have shown you how to create No-Heat Sock Curls:\nhttp://youtu.be/CzJKdHglFck\n\n...but here we show you a very interesting, yet easy way to get voluminous curls without heat!  It uses a technique we call \"Cocooning,\" yes, cocooning as in a caterpillar turning into a butterfly!  {We originally learned this curl from http://www.youtube.com/beautyklove, so be sure to check her out.}\n\nThis technique only provides the curl on the bottom half of the hair, so I find that a headband or hat is the perfect accessory for this hairstyle!  The curls also last for a few days, so you can combine these curls as a 2nd or 3rd day 'do using any of our accent braids, twists, etc!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, bandana, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 15-20 minutes\n\nTo see more photos of this style, please visit...\nhttp://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

Many of you have already seen our tutorial for \"No-Heat Headband Curls here... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rdfgu3zqY4\n\nInstead of using a headband on this one, we used simple socks!  This is super easy to do, and the curls last a long time. I also like pin curls or rag/paper bag curls but they can take up to 20-30 minutes or more to put in.  This takes literally 2 minutes to put in, and you can style the hairdo the next day in any number of combinations!\n\nI tied in the socks lower, because we are totally into the low curls lately... but you could roll them all the way up for more volumous curls up top.\n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHSockCurls\n\nIt is key to make sure that the hair is slightly damp {not wet} anytime you want no-heat curls. If the hair is too wet, it will not hold the curl as well.\n\nAren't these ho-heat curl hairstyles so fun?  Enjoy!","date":"2012-01-09T01:03:27.000Z"}]}
