Although the braid looks fairly complex, it really is one of the easiest to create. If you know how to braid a simple 3-strand braid, then this one is going to be easy for you!\n\nTo see your own photo recreations of this hairstyle featured in our app, feel free to tag your photos on IG with: #CGHRickRackBraid\n\nWe use this braid as an accent, simply because it has so much already going on with it. This braid could also be cute as a tieback. \n\nPlease be sure to give this video a BIG \"üëç\" if you loved it, and leave a comment below telling us if you've watched the twins' Parent Trap parody video {link at the top of description box}!\n\nüíã's -Mindy\n \n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 1 small hair elastic, 2 small bobby pins, hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 3-5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Easy\n\nClothing Links: All links to clothing worn in this video are on our website here... http://www.cutegirlshairstyles.com/?p=9129\n\n_____\n\nWe post a new hairstyle tutorial every Sunday night {7pm CST}! \n\nSo, please don't forget to subscribe to our YouTube channel...\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/CuteGirlsHairstyles?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFollow CGH on Facebook: @CuteGirlsHairstyles\nFollow CGH on Twitter: @CuteGirlHair\nFollow CGH on Pinterest: @MrsHairdo\nFollow CGH on Instagram: @CuteGirlsHairstyles\n___\n\nFTC Disclaimer: This is not a sponsored video.\n___\n\nMusic: Only You\nby Katie Sky (http://katiesky.com)\niTunes Link USA: http://labrecs.com/OnlyUS\niTunes Link UK: http://labrecs.com/Only\nLicense: Personal emailed permission from Katie herself.","date":"2015-06-15T00:05:26.000Z"},{"id":"aji4YSjkTWo","thumbnail":"http://img.youtube.com/vi/aji4YSjkTWo/0.jpg","title":"Ribbon Accent Loony Braid | Cute Braid Ideas","description":"Also be sure to tag #CGHRibbonLoonyBraid on your recreations of this hairstyle on Instagram and Twitter!

CGH#3's hair showcases the braids very well!\n\nThese braids are very similar to our Loony Braids {http://youtu.be/Gk1qjTzh8H4}, but instead of braiding with one large strand and two smaller strands... these \"textured\" braids are made with one small strand and two large strands.\n\nThe pullback I did here is optional, and you will need to bobby pin it to be sure it covers the third braid.  You can also use these braids as accents in any hairstyle. \n\nHope you enjoy!\n\nItems Needed: Brush, rat-tail comb, spray bottle, 3 small hair elastics, 1-2 bobby pins and hairspray {if desired}.\n\nTime Requirement: 5 minutes\n\nSkill Level: Medium\n\n* ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *\n\nWant to become a \"Super Fan\" of the week, and potentially have your photo appear in a future video?

This braid is not anything new.  There is a 3-strand (like this one) and a 4-strand version.  This is a perfect \"Back-to-School\" look because it can be used on teens as well without looking like you belong on a series like \"Little House on the Prairie\".  You may add accessories as you deem necessary. \n\nFeel free to tag your own photos of this hairstyle with: #CGHLoonyBraids\n\nEnjoy!","date":"2010-08-23T02:56:17.000Z"}]}
