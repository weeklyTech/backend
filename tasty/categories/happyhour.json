Let cool for a few minutes, and then, using a mesh sieve, strain the strawberry goodness into a bowl. Use a spoon to press the strawberries up against the mesh so you get every last beautiful drop of strawberry syrup. Place the syrup in the refrigerator to cool a bit.\n\nCombine the kiwi slices and the remaining strawberries in a pitcher, and add the rum, white wine, strawberry syrup, and the juice of three oranges (in a pinch, you could also sub a few splashes of bottled orange juice, or even lemonade, for the fresh orange juice). Give it all a good stir and then pop the pitcher in the refrigerator for at least four hours to let all of the flavors come together.\n\nWhen you’re ready to serve, add around three-quarters of the chilled sparkling wine to the pitcher.

Combine the tequila, limeade (or lemonade), and orange juice in your dish, give it a stir, and then pop it in the freezer for at least five hours. Once it’s frozen into a solid and you’re ready to serve, take out of the freezer and, using a spoon, scrape along the surface to pull up beautiful shards of frozen margarita (the motion is somewhere between scooping up ice cream and scraping off a car windshield in winter).\n\nFeel free to play around with the ratio on this — it’ll work with a bit less tequila and more juice, or a bit more tequila and less juice (whatever kind of party you’re looking for). Salted rim totally optional. Enjoy! \n\nMUSIC\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc. All Tasty music provided by Audio Network and Warner Chappell Inc.
